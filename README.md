# Airbnb Pricing Prediction Project

This project aims to predict Airbnb rental prices using a variety of machine learning models, with a particular focus on CatBoost. The project is structured into multiple phases including data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, model development, and inference.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into the following directories:

- **00_instructions**: Contains the project instructions and guidelines.
- **01_data**: Contains the raw data and the final inference file `outbound/catboost/inference_outbound.csv`.
- **02_preprocess**: Scripts for data preprocessing.
- **03_eda**: Notebooks for Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).
- **04_model_dev**: Notebooks for model development, including training and evaluation.
- **05_inference**: Scripts for making predictions on new data.
- **06_functions**: Custom functions used across the project.
- **07_artifacts**: Contains the saved models and other artifacts.
- **08_analysis**: Contains the answers to the questions in the instructions.
